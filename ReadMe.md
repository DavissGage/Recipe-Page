## My process

### Built with

- HTML, CSS, TAILWINDCSS :)

### What I learned

I learned how to set up a basic static page using tailwind css, How fast you can apply and add responsiveness to a project with tailwind. 
Always starting with mobile first, because I did not lol. It would've made this project much easier.

### Continued development

While building this project I found that for future projects the reuse of styles with tailwind could come in handy for "Dryer Code".

### Useful resources

Having this open in your browser when working the tailwind to reference styles is very handy because im not super human, I cant remember everything lol.
